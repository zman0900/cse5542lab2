The freeglut library and headers are included.  The following files are from
freeglut.sourceforge.net:
	win32/include/GL/*
	win32/lib/*
	freeglut.dll

No sln file is included for Visual Studio because the program will not link

your copy of Windows, it can generate a Visual Studio solution by doing the 
following:
Open "Visual Studio Command Prompt"
cd to source directory
Run (don't forget the dot):
	<path-to-cmake-bin>\cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" .
Open the generated cse5542lab2.sln file
